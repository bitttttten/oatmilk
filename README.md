ðŸš¨ this library is not yet released, and still on version 1 ðŸš¨

## Introduction

oatmilk is a minimal, decoupled, routing library for React.

âœ… SSR Friendly

âœ… Flexible

âœ… Testable

âœ… [Decoupled](#decoupled)

## Docs

-   [Data fetching and transition hooks](https://github.com/bitttttten/oatmilk/blob/master/docs/transition-hooks.md)
-   [Server rendering](https://github.com/bitttttten/oatmilk/blob/master/docs/server-rendering.md)
-   [Typescript](https://github.com/bitttttten/oatmilk/blob/master/docs/typescript.md)

## Instructions

### Install

`yarn add oatmilk`

### Wrap your App and send in routes

```js App.tsx
import oatmilk from 'oatmilk'
import { IRoutes } from 'oatmilk/dist/types'

const routes: oatmilk.IRoutes = [
    {
        name: 'home',
        path: '/',
        view: () => <p>The world never says hello back..</p>,
    },
    {
        name: 'user',
        path: '/user/:id',
        view: React.lazy(() => import('./Pages/User.tsx')),
    },
    {
        name: 'notFound',
        path: '/404',
        view: React.lazy(() => import('./Pages/NotFound.tsx')),
    },
]

ReactDOM.render(
    <oatmilk.Provider routes={routes}>
        <App />
    </oatmilk.Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

### Render a RouterView

The `RouterView` will render the current route's `view`

```js App.tsx
export function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <Navigation />
            <Header />
            <oatmilk.RouterView />
            <Footer />
        </>
    )
}
```

### Render some links

No need to generate the paths here, oatmilk will find the route and generate a path for you that is derived from the state.

```js App.tsx
function Navigation() {
    return (
        <>
            <oatmilk.Link routeName='home'>Go home</oatmilk.Link>
            <oatmilk.Link routeName='home' state={{ user: 'bitttttten' }}>
                Go to my page
            </oatmilk.Link>
        </>
    )
}
```

## Decoupled

oatmilk is state first, and everything else is derived from this. The current route is held in state and effects like updating the URL, are managed after the fact.

Decoupling your state and data fetching from your view helps you keep a declarative approach to your codebase. It also makes reasoning and testing simplier, and greatly reduces the complexity of server rendering and pre-fetching data.
